Computational Graphics and Visualization
# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This course is almost like a full stack development course. OpenGL was easily one of the toughest things to learn in the span of 8 week but it has tought me so much. A new design skill I developed is the use entirety of OpenGL itself. From the creating textures and lighting to making sure that your shapes and polygons are initialized correctly. It was a lot, but in a good way.
# What design process did you follow for your project work?
I kept my program organized. In the beginning I would get confused trying to fit everything into a single source.cpp file. Once I seperated the making of the shapes, the render function, the structs, and the scene managment it became much easier to manage. 
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think that you should never cram everything into a single file unless your program is very small. Keeping things modular is one of the pillars of programming and should always be followed.
# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Lots and lots of studying went into this course. As I mentioned before, I had a huge learning curve ahead of me and I used any and all resources to cram all of the information about OpenGL that I could. This means time-management. I had 2 other difficult courses and this I had to make sure I set time out to learn and complete coursework. So, managing my time was a crucial development strategy. 
# How did iteration factor into your development?
Loops play a huge part in OpenGL and rendering shapes. Everything is made from triangles so for loops were used for this. As well as while loops for the entire rendering of the scene to constantly manage input responses and rendering certain objects. The entire program itself is a loop so iteration played a huge role here. 
# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As I mentioned before, my first two modules were a mess. As I added more to my main project, I began to organize and keep things in their correct place. This allowed me to easily edit my scene and add functionality like lighting with almost no issue. Surprisingly, things got easier as the course progressed because of this. 
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathways?
I never knew exactly how graphics were computationally rendered. I am familiar with game creation IDE's like Unreal Engine, Blender, and Unity, but never fully understood exactly what was happening. Now that I have taken this course I have broadened my knowledge of this and will go into my future role as a software engineer with a better understanding of the functionality behind the scenes. While I am alomst done with my degree, I think that with this knowledge I will have an easier time understanding how some programs work as well.
